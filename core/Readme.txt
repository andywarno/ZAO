Before creating MySQL database, must change the paths in the Driver.sql file to match the path to the core folder on your machine

Open Mysql Command line and type the command: source <destination of the Driver.sql file inside core>

An example:  source c:\Users\zack\Desktop\ZAO\core\Driver.sql (on windows)

then simply run the program.
